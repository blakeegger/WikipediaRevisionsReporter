## Challenge #1 Complete

For challenge 1, I simply had the query engine class point to the wikiqueryengine class.

## Challenge #2 Complete

Create 2 classes; one is an interface class that will be used by the second class which is the alternative formatter class (RevisionFormatter2). Then create an instance of that class inside App class in the injection creator.

(EDIT: Realized that I forgot to change the layout of the revision formatter. Oops.)

## Challenge #3 Complete
Use stream and map H-O functions along with collection api.

## Reflection Question #1: Functional vs OO

I personally prefer OO programming because it is what I am most used to writing. 

## Reflection Question #2: Polymorphism and Dependency Inversion

Polymorphism is used in the query and in Revisionformatter. This allows the dependencies to be inverted using the Guice injector.
